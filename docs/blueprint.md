# **App Name**: Test Case Muse

## Core Features:

- Automated Test Case Generation: Generate test cases from a given URL, by exploring and analyzing the given webpage using an AI tool and extracting testable scenarios. The tool will attempt to detect the technology being used, such as React, Vue or Angular.
- Test Case Presentation: Display the generated test cases in a structured, user-friendly format (e.g., table or list).
- Manual Test Case Modification: Allow users to manually edit or add additional test cases as needed.
- Export Test Cases: Enable users to save and export the generated and modified test cases in common formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#32ade6) evokes trust, accuracy and clarity, but is less corporate-feeling than pure blue. Use this for primary buttons and key interactive elements.
- Background color: Very light gray (#f2f2f2) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Lime green (#bef264) to highlight generated AI recommendations and confirmations of saved assets, which contrasts well against the other blues in the design.
- Clean, sans-serif font for readability.
- Simple, modern icons for common actions (e.g., generate, edit, save, export).
- Clear and structured layout to easily present the generated test cases.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience.
